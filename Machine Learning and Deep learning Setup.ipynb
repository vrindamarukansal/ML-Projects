    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.\n",

    "Let's setup machine learning a fabulous tool and a need of the hour technology to solve real time problems and to create a end to end product .\n",
